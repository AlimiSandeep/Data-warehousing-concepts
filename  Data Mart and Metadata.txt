###	What is Data Mart?

	A data mart is focused on a single functional area of an organization and contains a subset of data stored in a Data Warehouse.

	-A data mart is a condensed version of Data Warehouse and is designed for 
		use by a specific department, unit or set of users in an organization. 
	  E.g., Marketing, Sales, HR or finance. It is often controlled by a single department in an organization.
	-Data Mart usually draws data from only a few sources compared to a Data warehouse.
	-Data marts are small in size and are more flexible compared to a Datawarehouse.

###	Why do we need Data Mart?

	-Data Mart helps to enhance user's response time due to reduction in volume of data
	-It provides easy access to frequently requested data.
	-Data mart are simpler to implement when compared to corporate Datawarehouse. 
	-Data is partitioned and allows very granular access control privileges.


###	Difference between Data Warehouse and Data mart

	Data Warehouse:
		-A Data Warehouse is a large repository of data collected from different organizations or departments within a corporation.
		-The designing process of Data Warehouse is quite difficult.
		-Data warehousing is broadly focused in all the departments. It is possible that it can even represent the entire company.
		-The size of the Data Warehouse may range from 100 GB to 1 TB+.
		-The implementation process of Data Warehouse can be extended from months to years.


	Data Mart:
		-A data mart is an only subtype of a Data Warehouse. It is designed to meet the need of a certain user group.
		-The designing process of Data Mart is easy.
		-Data Mart is subject-oriented, and it is used at a department level.
		-The Size of Data Mart is less than 100 GB.
		-The implementation process of Data Mart is restricted to few months.

*************************************************	Metadata	********************************************
Metadata is simply defined as data about data. 

-The data that is used to represent other data is known as metadata. For example, the index of a book serves as a metadata for the contents in the book. 
-In other words, we can say that metadata is the summarized data that leads us to detailed data.
-In terms of data warehouse, we can define metadata as follows.
	Metadata is the road-map to a data warehouse.
	Metadata in a data warehouse defines the warehouse objects.
	Metadata acts as a directory. This directory helps the decision support system to locate the contents of a data warehouse.
	
###	Categories of Metadata

	*Technical Metadata:
		This will store technical data such as tables attributes, their data types, size, primary key attributes, foreign key attributes, and any indexes.
		Intended for developers/testers/analysts/DBAs to build (or) maintain the system.

	*Business Metadata: 
		Data will be stored in business terms for the benefit of end-users/analysts/managers/ any users.
		It can be derived from any business documents and business rules.

	*Operational Metadata: 
		As we know the data into the DW system is sourced from many operational systems with diverse data types and fields. 
		DW extracts transform such data into the unique type and load all this data into the system.

		At the same time, it must be able to link back the data to its source system data. 
		The metadata that stores all these operational data sources information is known as Operational metadata.
