###	What is Data Modelling?
	Data modeling (data modelling) is the process of creating a data model for the data to be stored in a Database. 
	
	-This data model is a conceptual representation of Data objects, the associations between different data objects and the rules.
	-Data modeling helps in the visual representation of data and enforces business rules, regulatory compliances, and government policies on the data.
	-Data Models ensure consistency in naming conventions, default values, semantics, security while ensuring quality of the data.

	-Data model emphasizes on what data is needed and how it should be organized instead of what operations need to be performed on the data.
	
###	The two types of Data Models techniques are:

	1.Entity Relationship (E-R) Model
	2.Multidimensional modeling

###	Why use Data Model?

	A data model helps design the database at the conceptual, physical and logical levels.
	Data Model structure helps to define the relational tables, primary and foreign keys and stored procedures.
	It provides a clear picture of the base data and can be used by database developers to create a physical database.
	
###	Types of Data Models

*Conceptual: This Data Model defines WHAT the system contains.
	A conceptual data model identifies the highest-level relationships between the different entities. 

	Features of conceptual data model include:
		Includes the important entities and the relationships among them.
		No attribute is specified.
		No primary key is specified.
		
*Logical: Defines HOW the system should be implemented regardless of the DBMS.
	A logical data model describes the data in as much detail as possible, without regard to how they will be physical implemented in the database.
	
	Features of a logical data model include:
		Includes all entities and relationships among them.
		All attributes for each entity are specified.
		The primary key for each entity is specified.
		Foreign keys (keys identifying the relationship between different entities) are specified.
		Normalization occurs at this level.
		
------Conceptual vs Logical data model-----

-In a logical data model, primary keys are present, whereas in a conceptual data model, no primary key is present.
-In a logical data model, all attributes are specified within an entity. No attributes are specified in a conceptual data model.
-Relationships between entities are specified using primary keys and foreign keys in a logical data model. 
	In a conceptual data model, the relationships are simply stated, not specified, so we simply know that two entities are related, 
	but we do not specify what attributes are used for this relationship.
	
*Physical: This Data Model describes HOW the system will be implemented using a specific DBMS system.
	Physical data model represents how the model will be built in the database. 
	A physical database model shows all table structures, including column name, column data type, column constraints, 
	primary key, foreign key, and relationships between tables.
	
	Features of a physical data model include:

		Specification all tables and columns.
		Foreign keys are used to identify relationships between tables.
		Denormalization may occur based on user requirements.
		Physical data model will be different for different RDBMS. For example, data type for a column may be different between MySQL and SQL Server.
		
-----Logical vs Physical Data model-----

-Entity names are now table names.
-Attributes are now column names.
-Data type for each column is specified. Data types can be different depending on the actual database being used.
